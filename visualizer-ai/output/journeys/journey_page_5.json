      "concept_summary": "An ideal voltage source maintains a constant voltage regardless of the current drawn, while practical ones have some internal resistance.",
      "analogy": "Think of an ideal voltage source as a perfect water fountain: it always provides the same pressure (voltage) no matter how many pipes (loads) you connect to it. A practical voltage source is more like a real hose: the pressure drops when you attach too many sprinklers (loads).",

      "concept_summary": "A practical voltage source has internal resistance, which causes a drop in terminal voltage when current flows.",
      "analogy": "Imagine a battery as a practical voltage source. As you use more power from it (draw more current), the output voltage drops like how a water tap's flow rate decreases if the pipe is partially blocked.",

      "concept_summary": "Ohm’s law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, provided physical conditions such as temperature remain constant.",
      "analogy": "This can be likened to water flowing through a pipe: if you increase the pressure (voltage), more water will flow (current) assuming no changes in the pipe’s size or friction (resistance).",

      "Internal resistance leads to voltage drop.",

    "correct_option_index": 0,
    "explanation": "This is because practical voltage sources, having some internal resistance (like a hose with water pressure), experience a drop in terminal voltage when current flows through them."
