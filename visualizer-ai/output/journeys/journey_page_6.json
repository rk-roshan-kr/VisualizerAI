      "analogy": "Imagine a water pipe system where the voltage is like the pressure difference, current is the flow rate of water, and resistance acts as a constriction in the pipe. The ratio of pressure to flow (voltage/current) stays constant unless the constriction changes or the material properties alter.",

      "concept_summary": "Understanding Kirchhoff’s Current and Voltage Laws.",
      "analogy": "Think of a busy intersection where traffic (current) must flow in or out. The number of cars entering and exiting the same junction at any given time must balance, which is akin to KCL. Similarly, the energy (voltage) lost as cars move through different routes must sum up to zero around a loop, much like KVL.",

        "type": "compare",
        "prompt": "Compare and contrast Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and Voltage Law (KVL). What are the key differences in their applications?",
        "expected_answer": "KCL is about conservation of charge/current at a node, while KVL is about energy/voltage around a loop. KCL applies to both open and closed circuits, whereas KVL only works in closed circuits.",
        "clarification": "Focus on the application scenarios for each law."
