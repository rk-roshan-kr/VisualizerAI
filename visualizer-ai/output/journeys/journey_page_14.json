      "concept_summary": "In a series RLC circuit, all components (resistor, inductor, and capacitor) are connected end-to-end. The same current flows through each component.",
      "analogy": "Imagine water flowing through a pipe with a valve, a coil, and a balloon. The flow rate is the same everywhere in the pipe.",

      "title": "Voltage Across Components in Series RLC Circuit",
      "concept_summary": "The voltage across each component is determined by its impedance, which depends on the frequency (ω) of the AC supply.",
      "analogy": "Think of a road where traffic lights control the flow. Each light (component) has its own schedule and affects the overall traffic pattern (voltage).",

      "title": "Power Factor in Series RLC Circuit",
      "concept_summary": "The power factor is the cosine of the phase angle between the voltage and current. It indicates how much of the circuit's power is actually doing useful work.",
      "analogy": "Think of a phone charging cable. If it’s not fully charged, some energy is lost as heat (lower power factor).",

        "type": "compare",
        "prompt": "Compare the power factor when the circuit has only R to when it includes L and C.",
        "expected_answer": "Purely resistive: 1; With inductor and capacitor: less than 1",
        "clarification": "In phase for resistor, lagging for inductor, leading for capacitor"
