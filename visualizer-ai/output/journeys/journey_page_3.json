      "concept_summary": "AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) are two different types of electrical supplies. They differ in their properties, applications, and effects on electronic devices.",
      "analogy": "Think of AC as a river that flows back and forth while DC is like a steady stream running in one direction.",

        "type": "compare",
        "prompt": "Compare the flow characteristics between AC and DC supply. What are two key differences?",
        "expected_answer": "AC changes direction, while DC maintains a single direction.",

      "title": "Key Electrical Elements: Resistance and Inductance",
      "concept_summary": "Resistance opposes the flow of current, while inductance resists changes in current. Both are crucial for understanding circuit behavior.",
      "analogy": "Resistance is like a narrow road that slows down traffic, whereas inductance acts like a traffic light that controls the speed and direction of cars based on past conditions.",
      "interactive_element": {
        "type": "predict",
        "prompt": "Predict what would happen if there were no resistance or inductance in an electrical circuit. What are the consequences for current flow?",
        "expected_answer": "Without resistance, current could flow uncontrollably; without inductance, sudden changes in current might lead to instability.",

      "concept_summary": "Capacitance stores energy in the form of an electric field, making it essential for maintaining voltage levels across a circuit.",
      "analogy": "Capacitance is like a water tank that fills up when there's excess pressure and releases water to maintain steady flow rates.",

    "correct_option_index": 0,
    "explanation": "Household appliances use AC due to its wider availability and efficiency in distribution networks. Gadgets often use DC, as it is easier to convert from AC through rectifiers."
