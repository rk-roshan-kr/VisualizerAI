•   It states that “the algebraic sum of all the currents meeting at a point or node  or a junction of a circuit is zero”.   Σ  I = 0   •   In other words, the sum of incoming current towards node or junction is  equal to sum of outgoing current from node.   •   While applying the KCL the incoming current   towards node   is taken as  positive and the outgoing current   from node  is taken as negative.    •   It determines the current flowing through each branch of the network.                              Fig.1  –   KCL   Considering the above figure and apply Kirchhoff’s Current Law:   i1   + i2   –   i3   –   i4   –   i5   + i6   = 0………. (1)   The equation (1) can also be written as:   i 1   + i 2   + i 6   = i 3   + i 4   + i 5       Hence   s um of incoming currents = Sum of outgoing currents
