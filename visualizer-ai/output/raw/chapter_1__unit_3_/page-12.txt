12.   Series RL Circuit :       In Series RL Circuit, resistor and inductor are connected in series, so current flowing  through both the elements is same    i.e IR=IL=I.   We are using ac voltage V = Vm sin ω t   VR   –   voltage across the resistor R   VL   –   voltage across the inductor L   V  –   Total voltage of the circuit   From the phasor diagram we can write                                                                            Fig.  Phasor diagram of series RL circuit                From the phasor diagram we can write phase angle such as                     Power Factor of the circuit will be
