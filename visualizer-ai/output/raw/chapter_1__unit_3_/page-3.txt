Electric Potential   Potential Difference   The unit of electric  potential is volts.   The unit of potential  difference is volts.     1.   Comparison between AC and DC   Supply:   2.   Basic Electrical Elements   a)   Resistance :   It is the property of resistor which opposes the flow of c urrent . It is  represented by R and its unit is in ohm.     b)   Inductance:  It is property of inductor by virtue of which it opposes  the sudden  change of  electric current passing through conductor. It stores energy in the form of  magnetic field. It is represented by L and its unit is henry.     c)   Capacitance:  It is the property of two plate capacitor which stores energy in the  form of electric field. It is represented by C and its unit is in farad.                                                                        S.NO.   AC   DC     1   It  is  defined  as  a  supply  in  which  magnitude and directions both vary with  respect to time.   It  is  defined  as  a  supply  in  which  magnitude  and  directions  both  are  constant at any instant of time.   2   Supply frequency is 50Hz   Supply frequency is 0 Hz   3   The  d irection  of  flow  of  electrons   is  bidirectional   The d irection of flow of electrons   is  Unidirectional   4   It is o btained  f rom   Alternators.   It is o btained  f rom   Generators, battery,  solar cell.   5   The value of power factor lies between 0  and 1.   The value of power factor is always  unity i.e. 1.   6   The  AC  load  can  be  capacitive,  inductive, or resistive .   T he load on DC is always resistive .   7   The AC is converted into DC using a  device named rectifie r.   T he DC is converted into AC using a  device named inverter.   8   AC  is  widely  used  in  industrial  equipment and consumer electronics like  AC, Freezer, Cooler, washing machines,  lights, and fans;   DC is used in electronic gadgets and  small devices like clocks, laptops, cell  phones, and Sensors.
