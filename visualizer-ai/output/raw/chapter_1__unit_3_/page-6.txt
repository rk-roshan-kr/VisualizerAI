  •   In other words, Ohm’s law can also be stated as;   h ence ratio of voltage and  current is always equal when physical conditions are constant.                            Limitations of Ohm’s Law :   •   Not applicable in unilateral networks.    •   It is not applicable for the non - linear network.    •   Their parameter likes resistance, inductance, capacitance and frequency,  etc., not remain constant with the times.     7.   Why We Need Electricity?   •   Electricity   is the most versatile and easily controlled form of energy. At the  point of use it is practically loss - free and essentially non - polluting.    •   Electricity   is weightless, easier to transport and distribute, and it represents  the most efficient way of consuming energy.   •   Electricity is needed to turn computers, refrigerators, televisions and all  other electrical objects to work.   •   Electricity is also further required to operate electrical vehicles.   •   Electricity Provide Safety and Security .   •   Electricity Plays an Important Role in Agriculture .     8.   Difference Between KVL and KCL :     S. NO.   KCL   KVL   1.   It is b ased on  law of  conservation of  Charge.   It  is  b ased  on  law  of  conservation of energy .   2.   It  states that   “ the algebraic sum of  all the currents  meeting  at  a point or  node  or a junction of a circuit is  zero”.   Σ  I = 0   It  states that  “ the algebraic sum  of  all  the  voltages   in  closed   circuit is zero”.   Σ  V = 0   3.    Applicable  for  open  as  well  as  closed circuit.   Only  applicable  for  closed  circuit.   4.   Nodal Analysis    Mesh or loop analysis   5.   First law of Kirchhoff’s   Second law of Kirchhoff’s     9.   Kirchhoff’ Current Law :
