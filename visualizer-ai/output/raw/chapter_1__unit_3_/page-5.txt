a)   Ideal Voltage source:  A voltage source is a two - terminal device whose  voltage at any instant of time is constant and is independent of the  current drawn from it. Such a voltage source is called an Ideal Voltage  Source and have zero internal resistance .   Practical Voltage  Source : Sources having some amount of internal  resistances are known as Practical Voltage Source. Due to this internal  resistance; voltage drop takes place, and it causes the terminal voltage  to reduce.     Fig.  –   Ideal and Practical Voltage source.     b)   Ideal Current Source:   An ideal current source is a two - terminal circuit  element  which  supplies  the  same  current  to  any  load  resistance  connected across its terminals.   It has infinite resistance.   Practical  Current Source :  A practical current source is represented as  an ideal current source connected with the resistance in parallel.     Fig.  –   Ideal and Practical  Current   source.     6.   Ohm’s Law:     •   It states that the current through any two points of the conductor is directly  proportional  to  the  potential  difference  applied  across  the  conductor,  provided physical conditions i.e. temperature, etc. do not change. It is  measured in ( Ω)   ohm.   •   Mathematically it is expressed as:
