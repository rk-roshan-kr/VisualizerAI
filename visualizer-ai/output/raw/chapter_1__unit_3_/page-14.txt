Series RLC Circuit :     In Series RLC Circuit, resistor, inductor and capacitor are connected in series, so current  flowing through both the elements is same    i.e I R   = I  C  = I L = I.   We are using ac voltage V = Vm sin ω t   V R   –   voltage across the resistor R   V L   –   voltage across the inductance L   V  C    –   voltage across the capacitance C   V  –   Total voltage of the circuit   From the phasor diagram we can write       From the phasor diagram we can write phase angle such as     Power factor of the circuit
