•   The laws of KCL and KVL are not suitable for AC circuits of high frequencies.   •   Current law is applied only when the electric charge in a circuit is constant.   •   KVL is applied in an assumption that magnetic fields do not change in a closed  circuit.     11.     Voltage Division Rule :     •   The voltage division rule can be understood by considering a series circuit shown  below.    •   In a series circuit, voltage is divided, whereas the current remains the same.   •   The voltage drop across r 1  is E 1   and voltage drop across r 2   is E 2     Current   Division Rule:     •   A parallel circuit acts as a current divider as the current divides in all the branches in a  parallel circuit, and the voltage remains the same across them.   •   There are two resistance R1 and R2 are connected in parallel.
