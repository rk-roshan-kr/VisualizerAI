                   3.   Electric Potential Difference:    •   It is defined as the amount of work done to carrying a unit charge from one  point to another in an electric field.    •   In other words, the potential difference is defined as the difference in the  electric potential of the two charged bodies   and its unit is volt.

Active Element:   These are elements which have their own source of energy  mean that it does not need any external source of energy.   Example: Voltage source, current source.   Passive Element:  These are those elements which have not their own  source of energy mean that it needs any external source of energy .   Example:   Resistance, inductance, capacitance .     2.   Linear  Element:  These  are  those  elements  which  have  constant  characteristics or which shows linear graph or which obeys ohms law .    Example:   Resistor,   capacitor, inductor .   Non - linear Element:  These are those elements which do not have constant  characteristics or which shows non -   linear graph   or which do not obey ohms  law .    Example:  T ransistors,  Diode.     3.   Unilateral Element:  These are those elements in which conduction of  current is in one direction only is termed as   unilateral    element.    Example:   Diode, Transistor   Bilateral Element:  These are those elements in which conduction of current  is  in  both  directions  in  an   element   with  same  magnitude  is  termed  as   bilateral element.   Example:   Resistance; Inductance; Capacitance     5.   Types of Sources:   T he source is an active network element meant for generating electrical  energy.
