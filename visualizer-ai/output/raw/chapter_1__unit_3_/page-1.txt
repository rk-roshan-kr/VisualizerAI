Q1.  Electric Circuit :    1.   An electric circuit is a representation of a real circuit that is used to connect different  devices.   2.   Electric Circuit is the closed loops or paths, in which the current flows. In electric  circuits, various components are added that perform various task.   3.   An electric circuit consists of a number of circuit components such as resistors,  inductors, capacitors, etc.   Types of Electrical circuit:   1.   Open circuit:  An open circuit is defined as an  electric circuit   where the current does  not flow.   1.   Hence in an open circuit, the current flowing through the circuit is zero, and  voltage is present (non - zero).   2.   As   Power is equal to V * I, and the current is equal to zero.   Hence power is also  equal to zero, and no power dissipates from an open circuit.     3.   An open circuit may be as a result of a component failure or disconnection of  a conducting path such as breaking of a conducting wire.   For any electrical circuit, by Ohm’s law, we have,   R=V / I   Now in case of open circuit, the current through the circuit is zero   (I=0) , thus,   R=V / 0   =   ∞   Hence,  for  any value of voltage, the resistance is  infinite in  open circuit  conditions.   2.   Closed circuit:  A  closed   circuit is defined as an  electric circuit   where the current flow   when voltage is applied .
