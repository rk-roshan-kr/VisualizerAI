Series RC circuit:   In Series RC Circuit, resistor and capacitor are connected in series, so current flowing  through both the elements is same    i.e I  C  =I L =I.     We are using ac voltage V = Vm sin ω t     V R   –   voltage across the resistor R   V  C    –   voltage across the capacitance C   V  –   Total voltage of the circuit   From the phasor diagram we can write       From the phasor diagram we can write phase angle.     Power Factor of the circuit will be
