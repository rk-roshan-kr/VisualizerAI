4.   A closed circuit is continuous path.   3.  Short  circuit:  A  short   circuit is defined as an  accidentally  electric circuit   or connection of  wire.     •   The common reasons of occurrence of short circuit in an electric circuit are insulation  failure, components get shorted, etc.   The effect of short circuit in both series circuits  and parallel circuit is almost same.   •   Mathematically, by Ohm’s law, we have,   R=V   /  I   When there is a short circuit in the circuit, the circuit current becomes infinitely high,  thus,   R=V   /  ∞   =   0   Hence, a short circuit ideally offers a resistance of zero ohms in the path of current.   Q2. Electric Potential and potential difference:   Electric Potential   Potential Difference   Electric potential is the  work done per unit charge  to bring the charge from  infinity to a point in an  electric field.   The amount of work done  to bring an unit charge from  one point to other point  in  the electric field.   Electric potential is defined  at a point.   Potential difference is  defined between two points  in electric field.
