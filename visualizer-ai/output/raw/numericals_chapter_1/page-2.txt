    Q6. A 230 V, 50 Hz ac supply is applied to a coil of 0.06 H inductance and 2.5 resistance connected   in series with a 6.8 µF capacitor. Calculate (i) Impedance (ii) Current (iii) Phase angle between   current   and voltage   (iv) power   factor   (v) power   consumed     Q7.  A coil of pf 0.6 is in series with a 100µF capacitor. When connected to a 50Hz supply, the   potential   difference   across   the   coil   is   equal   to   the   potential   difference   across   the   capacitor.   Find   the   resistance   and   inductance   of the   coil.
