Types:   •   Lagging Power Factor:   For  inductive loads   (current lags voltage).   •   Leading Power Factor:   For  capacitive loads   (current leads voltage).     SHORT QUESTION (UNIT - 3)     1.)  What does a single - phase mean?   Answer: -   A single - phase system or circuit which generates or uses single alternating voltage.   2.) Do houses use single - phase supply?   Answer: -   Generally, homes are supplied with single - phase supply.   3.) On which principles does the single - phase transformer operate?   Answer: -   Faraday’s law   of Electromagnetic Induction and Mutual Induction .   4.) What is the transformer “Turns Ratio”?   Answer: -   N1/N2 = V1/V2 = K = Turns Ratio   5.) Give two uses of a single - phase transformer   Answer: -       •   In television sets for voltage regulation   •   To step - up power in home inverters   6.) How to minimize Eddy current loss?   •   By using less thickness of laminations   •   By using less value of Magnetic flux density   7.) How to minimize Hysteresis loss?   •   By using good magnetic material.   •   By using less value of Magnetic flux density   8 .) Why transformers are rated in kVA ?     Copper loss of a transformer depends on current and iron loss on voltage . So rating is in  kVA.   9.) What is the condition for maximum efficiency of transformer   Answer: -   iron losses =cu losses   10.) Define voltage regulation?   Answer: -   Voltage regulation is a measure of change in the voltage magnitude between the  sending and receiving end of a component.   Q11. What is ohms law and its limitation?
