Ans -   Ohm’s law states that the current ( I ) flowing through a conductor is directly  proportional to the potential difference ( V ) across it, provided the temperature and other  physical conditions remain constant.   푉 = 퐼푅     Limitations:   1.   Ohm’s law is not applicable to non - ohmic materials (like diodes, transistors).   2.   It fails when temperature, pressure, or physical conditions of the conductor change.
