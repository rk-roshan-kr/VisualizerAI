Q14. State the transformation ratio of a transformer and derive its EMF  equation.   Ans - The  transformation ratio (k)   is the  ratio of secondary voltage to primary voltage ,  and it is equal to the  ratio of secondary turns to primary turns .   푘 = 퐸 2 퐸 1 = 푁 2 푁 1 = 퐼 1 퐼 2     where:   •   퐸 1 = EMF per phase on the  primary winding   •   퐸 2 = EMF per phase on the  secondary winding   •   푁 1 = Number of turns on the  primary winding   •   푁 2 = Number of turns on the  secondary winding   •   퐼 1 , 퐼 2 = Primary and secondary currents   Types of Transformers (based on k):   Type   Condition   Effect   Step - up transformer   (k > 1) (N 2   > N 1 )    Secondary voltage  greater   than primary  voltage   Step - down  transformer   (k < 1) (N 2   < N 1 )     Secondary voltage  less   than primary  voltage     E.M.F.  equation of transformer:   The magnetic flux in the core changes sinusoidally:   Φ = Φ 푚 sin ⁡ ( 휔푡 )     where  휔 = 2 휋푓 .
