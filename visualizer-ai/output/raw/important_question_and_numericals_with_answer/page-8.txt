An RC series circuit has a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C) connected to an AC supply.   •   In a pure resistor, voltage and current are in phase.   •   In a capacitor, current leads voltage by 90°.   •   In an RC circuit, the current leads voltage by an angle  휙 (less than 90°).   Power consumption:   •   The resistor (R) consumes real (active) power as heat.   •   The capacitor (C) alternately stores and releases energy in its electric field, so it does  not consume net power.   Therefore:   Average (Active) Power = 푽푰 퐜퐨퐬 ⁡ 흓     where   퐜퐨퐬 ⁡ 흓 = 푹 풁 and  풁 = √ 푹 ퟐ + ( ퟏ 흎푪 ) ퟐ     Circuit Type     Energy Storage Element   Power Factor   Nature of Load   RL Circuit     Magnetic field (L)   Lagging   Inductive   RC Circuit     Electric field (C)   Leading   Capacitive     Types of Power in AC Circuits   When an AC voltage is applied to a circuit, voltage and current may not be in phase  —   this  leads to three kinds of power:  Active ,  Reactive , and  Apparent   power.   1. Active Power (Real Power)   •   It is the  useful power   that actually  does work   in the circuit (like producing heat,  light, or motion).   •   Only the  resistor (R)   consumes this power.   •   Formula:   푃 = 푉퐼 cos ⁡ 휙     where   푉 = RMS voltage,   퐼 = RMS current,   휙 = phase angle between voltage and current.
