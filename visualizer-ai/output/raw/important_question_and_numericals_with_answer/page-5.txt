  Concept of Power Factor   The power factor (pf) is the cosine of the phase angle ( φ)  between voltage and current.   Power Factor = cos ⁡ 휙 = 푃 푆     •   If  φ = 0°:  Power factor = 1 (purely resistive load → all power is active).   •   If  φ > 0°:  Power factor < 1 (inductive or capacitive load → some power is reactive).
