Ans -   Ohm’s law states that the current ( I ) flowing through a conductor is directly  proportional to the potential difference ( V ) across it, provided the temperature and other  physical conditions remain constant.   푉 = 퐼푅     Limitations:   1.   Ohm’s law is not applicable to non - ohmic materials (like diodes, transistors).   2.   It fails when temperature, pressure, or physical conditions of the conductor change.   Q12. Describe how power is consumed in RL and RC circuits.   Discuss the  types of power (active, reactive, and apparent power) and derive expressions  for each in terms of voltage, current, and power factor ?               V.V.IMP.   Ans -   Power in an AC circuit   In an AC circuit, both resistive and reactive (inductive or capacitive) components determine  how electrical power is consumed or stored.   Instantaneous power is:   푝 ( 푡 ) = 푣 ( 푡 ) × 푖 ( 푡 )   Power in an RL circuit (Resistor – Inductor) :   An  RL series circuit   has a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) connected to an AC supply.   •   In a pure resistor, voltage and current are  in phase   → power is fully consumed as heat.   •   In an inductor, current  lags voltage   by 90° → no net power is consumed; power is  alternately stored in and released from the magnetic field.   •   In an  RL circuit , the current lags voltage by an angle  휙 (less than 90°).   Power consumption:   •   Only the  resistive part (R)   consumes real power, converted into  heat .   •   The  inductive part (L)   stores and returns energy to the source each cycle  —   no net  power loss.   Therefore:   Active Power = 푉퐼 cos ⁡ 휙     where   cos ⁡ 휙 = 푅 푍 and  푍 = √ 푅 2 + ( 휔퐿 ) 2   Power in an RC circuit (Resistor – Capacitor)
