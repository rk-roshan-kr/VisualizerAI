(ii)  Secondary voltage   Using the transformer voltage ratio formula:   푉 1 푉 2 = 푁 1 푁 2   푉 2 = 푉 1 × 푁 2 푁 1 = 230 × 100 1000 = 230 × 0 . 1 = 23   V     So, the  secondary voltage = 23 V .   (iii)  Type of transformer   Since  the  secondary  voltage  (23  V)   is  less  than  the  primary  voltage  (230  V) ,   it  reduces   the voltage.   Therefore, it is a  Step - down transformer .
