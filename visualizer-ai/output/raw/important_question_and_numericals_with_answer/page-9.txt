•   Unit:   Watt (W)   2. Reactive Power   •   It is the  power that oscillates   between the source and the reactive components  (inductor or capacitor).   •   It  does not do useful work   —   it is just energy stored and released every cycle.   •   Formula:   푄 = 푉퐼 sin ⁡ 휙     •   Unit:   Volt - Ampere Reactive (VAR)   •   푄 is  positive   for inductive circuits (lagging current) and  negative   for capacitive  circuits (leading current).   3. Apparent Power   •   It is the  total power   supplied by the source  —   the combination of active and reactive  power.   •   Formula:   푆 = 푉퐼     •   Unit:   Volt - Ampere (VA)     Relationship Between Them   They form a  power triangle :   푆 2 = 푃 2 + 푄 2     and   cos ⁡ 휙 = 푃 푆 (Power Factor)   Type   Symbol   Formula   Unit   Meaning   Active Power   P   V I ⁡ cos ⁡ 휙   W   Useful power  (consumed)   Reactive Power   Q   V Isin ⁡ 휙   VAR   Power stored &  returned   Apparent Power   S   (V I)   VA   Total supplied power
