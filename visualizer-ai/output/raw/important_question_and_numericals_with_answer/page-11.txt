A single - phase transformer has 1000 turns on the primary and 100  turns on the secondary. If the primary is connected to 230 V, calculate: (i)  Turns ratio (ii) Secondary voltage (iii) Type of transformer   Ans -   Given data:   •   Primary turns,  푁 1 = 1000   •   Secondary turns,  푁 2 = 100   •   Primary voltage,  푉 1 = 230   V   (i)  Turns ratio   Turns ratio = 푁 1 푁 2 = 1000 100 = 10     So, the turns ratio is  10:1 .
