Semi conduct or mat er ials, Intr insic and Extr insic Semiconduct or s: A semiconductor substance has an electrical property that sits between an insulator and a conductor. Si and Ge are the greatest examples of semiconductors. There are two types of semiconductors: intrinsic semiconductors and extrinsic semiconductors (p-type and n-type). The intrinsic kind of semiconductor is pure, but the extensive type contains impurities to make it conductive. At ambient temperature, intrinsic conductivity will be nil, but extrinsic conductivity will be minimal. With doping and energy band diagrams, this article provides an overview of intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors. Intr insic Semiconduct or : The definition of an intrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor that is exceedingly pure. According to the energy band theory, the conductivity of this semiconductor will be zero at ambient temperature. Si and Ge are two examples of intrinsic semiconductors.  〈   R . 
