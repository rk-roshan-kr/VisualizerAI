Q1. Explain single - phase transformer construction and working principle  along with a well - labelled diagram?   •   A single - phase transformer is a type of transformer which operates on single - phase  supply . It is most commonly used to increase (‘step up’) or decrease (‘step down’)  voltage levels between circuits.   •   A transformer is a passive electrical device that transfers electrical energy from one  circuit to another through the process of electromagnetic induction.    •   A transformer is a device which converts magnetic energy into electrical energy. It  consists of two electrical coils called as a primary winding and secondary winding. The  primary winding of a transformer receives power, while the secondary winding deliver s  power. A magnetic iron circuit called “core” is commonly used to wrap around these  coils.       Principle of Single - Phase Transformer:   The transformer works on the principle of Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and  mutual induction.   There are usually two coils  –   primary coil and secondary coil  –   on the  transformer core.   When an  AC voltage   is applied to the  primary winding , it produces a  changing magnetic flux   in the  core .   This changing flux  induces a voltage   in the  secondary  winding   according to  Faraday’s Law :   퐸 = − 푁 푑 Φ 푑푡   Where:   •   퐸 = induced emf (voltage)   •   푁 = number of turns
