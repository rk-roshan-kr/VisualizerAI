•   Φ = magnetic flux     Overall, a transformer carries out the following operations:   •   Transfer of electrical energy from one circuit to another   •   Transfer of electrical power through electromagnetic induction   •   Electric power transfer without any change in frequency   •   Two circuits are linked with mutual induction   Construction  of a Single - phase Transformer:   •   Core :    1)   The core acts as a support to the winding in the transformer. It also provides a  low reluctance path to the flow of magnetic flux. The winding is wound on the  core .   2)   Made of laminated  soft iron   or  silicon steel   to reduce  eddy current losses .   3)   Provides a  path for magnetic flux .   •   Windings:   1)   Windings are the set of copper wires wound over the transformer core. Copper  wires are used  because   high conductivity of copper minimises the loss in a  transform er.   2)   There are mainly two types of windings: primary windings and secondary  windings.   •   Primary   winding:   connected to the AC supply.   •   Secondary   winding:   connected to the load.   3)   Both are insulated from each other but  magnetically linked   through the core.   •   Insulation Agents   1)   Insulation is necessary for transformers to separate windings from each other  and to avoid short circuits.   2)   The following are used as insulation mediums in a transformer:                   Insulating oil                   Insulating tape                   Insulating paper                   Wood - based lamination   3)   The tank contains  transformer oil   for cooling and insulation.   Working Principle :   1.   AC supply   is given to the primary winding.   2.   Alternating current produces an  alternating magnetic flux   in the core.
