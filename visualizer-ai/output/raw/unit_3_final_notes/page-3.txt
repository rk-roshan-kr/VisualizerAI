3.   This varying flux links the secondary winding and  induces an emf   in it.   4.   The  magnitude of the secondary voltage   depends on the  turn’s ratio   or  transformation ratio .   T urns Ratio Formula   푉 1 푉 2 = 푁 1 푁 2     Where:   •   푉 1 , 푉 2 = primary and secondary voltages   •   푁 1 , 푁 2 = number of turns in primary and secondary   Types of Single - Phase Transformers :   1.   Step - Up Transformer   →  푉 2 > 푉 1   (Increases voltage, decreases current)   2.   Step - Down Transformer   →  푉 2 < 푉 1   (Decreases voltage, increases current)   Q2. What is transformation ratio?   Ans -   Transformation ratio is denoted by “k”               K= N 2 /N 1 =V 2 /V 1 = I 1 /I 2                   (1 -   for primary and 2 -   for secondary)   Case 1:   If  N2 > N1, K>1 , it is called a step - up transformer.   Case 2: If  N2< N1, K<1 , it is called a step - down transformer.   Q3. What are the different types of transformers?   1)   Based on Voltage Levels   Commonly used transformer types, depending on the voltage, are classified as follows:   Step - up Transformer:  They are used between the power generator and the power grid. The  secondary output voltage is higher than the input voltage.   Step - down Transformer:  These transformers are used to convert high - voltage primary supply  to low - voltage secondary output.   2)   Based on the Winding Arrangement   Autotransformer: It will have only one winding wound over a laminated core. The primary  and secondary share the same coil   3)   Based on Core construction   T he transformers are broadly classified into following two types :   Core Type Transformer :  Core type transformer consists of a single magnetic circuit.   Shell type transformer:   A shell type transformer consists of two magnetic circuits.
