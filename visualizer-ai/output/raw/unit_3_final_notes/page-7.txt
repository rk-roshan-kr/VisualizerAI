•   The power loss occurs in insulating materials like oil, solid insulation of the  transformer, etc. is known as dielectric loss.    •   The dielectric loss is significant only in transformers working on high voltages.   •   Although, in practice, the stray loss and dielectric loss are very small, constant  and may be neglected.   Total losses in transformer = Constant losses + Variable losses   Q7.  Explain the conditions for maximum efficiency of a transformer. Derive  the expression for maximum efficiency. :    The ratio of the  output power   to the  input power   in a transformer is known as efficiency of  transformer. The transformer efficiency is represented by Greek letter Eta ( η).   E fficiency,   η= Output   Power   / Input   Power   For a practical transformer, the input power is given by,                           Input   power   =   Output   power   +   Losses   η= V 2 I 2 cos ϕ 2   /   V 2 I 2 cos ϕ 2 +   P i +   P c   Condition for Maximum Efficiency :   For a given transformer, we have,   Output power = V 2 I 2 cos ϕ 2   The total copper loss is given by,   P cu =I 2 2 R 2   Maximum efficiency occurs when  copper loss = core loss .   Conditions for maximum efficiency:   Therefore, the transformer efficiency is given by,   η= V 2 I 2 cos ϕ 2   /   V 2 I 2 cos ϕ 2 +   P i +   I 2 2 R o2
