1. Core (Iron) Losses :  These occur in the transformer core due to alternating magnetic flux.   They are constant losses (independent of load).     •   T he symbol P i   to represent the iron loss. The iron loss consists of hysteresis loss (P h )  and eddy current loss (P e ). Thus, the iron loss is given by the sum of the hysteresis  loss and eddy current loss,    i.e.,   Iron   loss,   P i = Hysteresis   loss   (P h )   +   Eddy   current   loss   (P e ) .   P h   =   k h fB m 1.6                ⋅⋅⋅ (1)                                                         P e =   k e B m 2 f 2 t 2                  ⋅⋅⋅ (2)   •   k h   is a proportionality constant whose value depends upon the volume and quality of  the material of core.   •   k e   is a proportionality constant which depend on the volume and resistivity of material  of the core.   •   f is the frequency of the alternating flux in the core.   •   B m   is the maximum flux density in the core.   •   ‘ t ’   is the thickness of each core lamination.     (A)   Hysteresis Loss:    •   Loss of energy due to continuous magnetization and demagnetization of the transformer  is called hysteresis loss.   •   Hysteresis loss in a transformer can  be minimized by using soft magnetic materials  for the core like permalloy or silicon iron .     (B)   Eddy current   Loss:   •   Energy loss in a metallic plate when kept in a time - varying magnetic field causes eddy  current loss.   •   It can be minimized by using a laminated iron core in the transformer .   2.   Copper Loss / variable losses :   Occur due to the  resistance of primary and  secondary windings .   These depend on the  load current , so they are  variable losses .       •   Copper loss occurs in the form of heat energy lost due to the resistance of the  copper coils used in the windings of a transformer.   •   Copper loss can be minimized by using  t hicker conductors or low - resistance  copper/aluminium windings.   3.   Stray Loss:   •   The occurrence of stray losses is due to the presence of leakage field.   •     The percentage of these losses are very small as compared to the iron and  copper losses so they can be neglected.   4.   Dielectric   Loss:
