Q4.  What is the main  difference  between Core - type and Shell - type transformers?   S.NO.   CORE TYPE   SHELL TYPE   1.     In a core type transformer, the windings  surround the core of transformer .   In a shell type transformer, the magnetic  core  surrounds  the  windings  of  the  transformer.   2.   Core type transformer consists of a single  magnetic circuit.   A shell type transformer consists of two  magnetic circuits.   3.   A core type transformer has cylindrical  winding).   A shell type transformer has sandwich  winding.   4.   Core transformer has more copper loss.   The  copper  loss  in  a  shell  type  transformer is comparatively less.   5.   The  losses  are  more  in  core  type  transformer.   The  losses  are  less  in  shell  type  transformer.   6.   Maintenance is easy    Maintenance is difficult.   7.   Easy in design and construction   Complex in design and construction.    8.   Used for high voltage application like  power transformers, autotransformers     Used for low voltage application like  transformers in an  electronic circuit .       Q5 . What is efficiency of transformer?   Ans -   Efficiency ( 휂 ) is the ratio of output power to input power:   휂 = Output Power Input Power × 100     Typical efficiency: 95 – 98%
