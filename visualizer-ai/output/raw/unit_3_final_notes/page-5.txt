Q6. What are the advantages and application of single - phase transformer?   Ans -   Applications   of single - phase transformer:   •   Power distribution systems   •   Voltage regulation in domestic supply   •   Battery chargers   •   Welding machines   •   Electronic devices (adapters, inverters, etc.)   Advantages   •   High efficiency   •   Simple construction   •   Reliable and long - lasting   •   Requires little maintenance     Q6.  What are the different types of transformer losses? Describe methods to minimize  each loss in practical applications.       There are two main categories of losses:   1. Core (Iron) Losses   2. Copper (Winding) Losses   And sometimes we also include minor losses like stray and dielectric losses.
