Comp ar ison o f Zener Br eak down and A v alanche Br eak down Before understanding difference between  Zener Breakdown and A valanche Breakdown concept of zener diode is important. Zener diode:  Zener Diode is one of the most important semiconductor diodes used in our daily life. It is a specific diode that works in reverse bias conditions. It allows current to flow from anode to cathode and it also works in the reverse direction. A heavily doped p-n junction diode that works in reverse bias conditions is called a Zener Diode. They are special semiconductor devices that allow the current to flow in both forward and backward directions. For the Zener diode, the voltage drop across the diode is always constant irrespective of the applied voltage.  Fig.1 Zener Diode  〈   R . 
